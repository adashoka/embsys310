2.a: 396 bytes
2.b: 8196 bytes
2.c: program in main function is using the most ROM
2.d: not counting stack, it's again main function

3:

ROM usage optimization:
(1) avoid un-necessary initialization
(2) Keep Vector Interrupt Table simple -- don't define un-necessary handlers if your application doesn't need it


RAM usage optimization:
(1) reduce size of Stack -- since embedded SW is tailor made, why use more stack than what is needed? First, understand the input into the function
and later optimize it for stack usage.
